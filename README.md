# WELCOME TO MY RUST JOURNEY

## The Purpose
I want to learn Rust! I really saw a potential in this language. Instead in going back of the C++ roots and learn all the std lib there I decided to focus in Rust. Also, This is probably [Tantan's fault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZltAssmicsM).

## The Idea
Create a repository where all my Rust learning exercises and prototypes will be concentrate that can also help you (YES I SAID YOU!). In your own Rust journey.
